<h1> Luke Umhoefer's Amazing Proposal </h1>

<p> This site will serve to prove that I am indeed being taught how to write HTML code properly. <br>
So far, the class has taught me the basics. Things I have learned include...</p>

<h2> How to add clickable hyperlinks</h2>

<p> We also learned how to embed said hyperlinks into the middle of a paragraph without causing a line break. <br>
For example, click here to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Learn More!</a> or don't that's okay too</p>

<h2> How to add an image! </h2>

<img src= "../umhlukj/images/minecraft.png" alt= "Minecraft Image">

<h2> How to add a hyperlink to said image! </h2>

<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download">

<img src= "../umhlukj/images/minecraft.png" alt= "Minecraft download"></a>

<h4> Click the Image above to download Minecraft</h4>

<h6><i>This is my first example of a good site from which i would like to model my own</i></h6>

<!--this is a comment which i am using to comment about why I like the minecraft download page so much.
The site is laid out very simply, and I like the contrast between the dark gray background, and the 
green of the VERY WELL LABELED download hyperlinks.-->

<h2> What is my site going to include?</h2>

<p> I plan on attempting to recreate the minecraft download page. I will be using the same links <br>
that Mojang/ Microsoft uses. Hopefully I will be able to create a nice looking recreation.</p>

<h2> Target Audience</h2>

<p>The Target Audience for this site is little kids who don't know the difference between this site <br>
and the real Minecraft.net. Hopefully I will be able to goat them into giving me their mom's credit <br>
card details. I hope to also get them to install viruses on their computer</p>
<h6><i> Please read the comment's in the HTML file for this webpage</i></h6>
<!-- I feel like I have to clarify that this is 100% a joke, I was at one point the little kid who gave away
their mother's credit card details AND installed viruses on their computer. I hold a lot of anger to my childhood
self for having absolutely abhorrent internet browsing practices -->

<h2> Errors from the first iteration of this site </h2>
<ol>
	<li>Bad value C:\Users\umhlukj\Documents\HTML_2\images for attribute src on element img: illegal character in scheme data "\"<br>
	It turned out that I was calling to the image incorrectly. I was using the windows directory location for it, while HTML and Nu HTML <br>
	were both expecting the address in URL form, not windows FilePath form </li>

	<li> No other errors</li>
</ol>
